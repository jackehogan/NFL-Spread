Predict NFL Teams Score Against the Spread

Because the dataset used here explictly stated not to be used for gambing you will need to find a suitable one yourself. The inputs are each teams score, against the spread (ATS), for each week of the season. Predictions are then made using the previous games ATS. Choosing the optimal model and number of games to look back is still in progress.
